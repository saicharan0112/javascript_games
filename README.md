### External Games

"Before it Back OnLine" is a js13kGames 2019 competition entry by Aurélio A. Heckert (https://js13kgames.com/games/before-it-back-online). It is an interesting game that converts the classic chrome browser offline page 2-D game into a 3-D game.


"1024 Moves" is another js13kGames entry by Brégeau (https://js13kgames.com/entries/1024-moves). It is a game where you need to reach the orb by rolling the cube on the plane with obsticals at every level and I think the game is till what level one can reach in 1024 moves. 


"Sudoko" is a game cloned from the repo https://github.com/EduardoProfe666/sudoku-play. It has nice sounds and animations that I intend to use it for my other games. I had to debloat the game since I don't need a lot of things inside it and adjust some css to make it feel like home inside my homelab
